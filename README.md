## A collection of the classic games PACMAN and TETRIS

### TETRIS
- The goal of Tetris is to complete rows and not let the pieces reach the top of the screen
- Gameplay is very similar to the classic game with some additions 
        (levels, better graphics, and a "fun mode" on the max level)
### PACMAN
- The goal of Pac-Man is to collect pellets while avoiding the different colored ghosts in a maze
- This version of Pac-Man was made without a grid, which caused some complications
- The game is functionally nearly identical to the classic Pac-Man arcade game, but there are a few differences
